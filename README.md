# Stampix Web Assignment
The requirements and objectives are listed in the [original repo](https://github.com/stampix/web-assignment) from Stampix.
It is my very first assignment built with Typescript and React.
<br><br>
As a screening assignment, I do not have a lot of time to pick up the new language. My codes may not be sophisticated,  nor perfect, but this assessment opens the door for me to learn about TypeScript. 

Check out my [LIVE DEMO](https://serene-roentgen-11aee5.netlify.app) 

<br><br>

## My Work Flow: 
1. Set up components folder to store different parts for the page, and create types.d.ts file to define the type of props
2. Create 2 states `language` and `currentTemplate` to allow users to switch between languages and dynamically render the text template. 
3. Add `isSwitching` state as Boolean to add and remove class for the UI display
4. Work on responsiveness and animation to provide an optimal user interface for different screen size
<br><br>

## The Structure:
<img src="./src/assets/images/structure.png" width="200" />
<br>



Src
- Assets
    - fonts: 2 different fonts for the text
    - images: logos and images are located in this folder
- Components
    - Header: navbar with logo and language switch buttons, 
    - Home: the main part of text display and images
    - Template: store the translation template of different languages
- types.d.ts: store all the types and use them in components
<br><br>

## The Tools:
TypeScript &bull; React &bull; Visual Studio Code
