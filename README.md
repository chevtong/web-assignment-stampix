# Stampix Web Assignment

It is my very first assignment built with Typescript and React.
<br><br>
As a screening assignment, I do not have a lot of time to pick up the new language. My codes may not be sophisticated,  nor perfect, but this assessment opens the door for me to learn about TypeScript. 

The requirements and objectives are listed in the [original repo](https://github.com/stampix/web-assignment) from Stampix.

### Check out the [DEMO HERE]()

## My Work Flow: 
1. Set up components folder to store different parts for the page, and create types.d.ts file to define the type of props
2. Create 2 states `language` and `currentTemplate` to allow users to switch between languages and dynamically render the text template. 
3. Add `isSwitching` state as Boolean to add and remove class for the UI display
4. Work on responsiveness to provide an optimal user interface for different screen size
<br><br>

## Structure:
<img src="./src/assets/images/structure.png" width="200" />
<br>



Src
- Assets
    - fonts: 2 different fonts for the text
    - images: logos and images are located in this folder
- Components
    - Header: navbar with logo and language switch buttons, 
    - Home: the main part of text display and images
    - Template: store the translation template of different languages
- types.d.ts: store all the types and use them in components
